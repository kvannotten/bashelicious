# Bashelicious

**Bashelicous** is a project that wants to encourage people to enhance their bash experience.
It is inspired by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) but doesn't want to be a complete solution. 
**Bashelicious** wants to be a small solution with a few, small tweaks to greatly improve the encounters with bash, but not get in the way of existing configurations.
